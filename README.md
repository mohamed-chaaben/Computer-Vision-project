# COMP6321-GroupL
The project aims to implement the VGG11 model, optimizing hyperparameters through grid search, and compare its performance with a pretrained network. The top-performing model will then be used as an encoder for feature extraction and classification using a mix of supervised and unsupervised techniques on 3 datasets: NCT-CRC-HE-100K, Digital Pathology and Artifacts and Animal Faces-HQ. <br>

The files are in ipynb format, with each file providing a content description at the beginning. Typically, you only need to install the libraries specified at the start of the files and execute the code to perform training and testing.
