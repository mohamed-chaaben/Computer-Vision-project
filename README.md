# COMP6321-GroupL
The project aims to implement the VGG11 model, optimizing hyperparameters through grid search, and compare its performance with a pretrained network. The top-performing model will then be used as an encoder for feature extraction and classification using a mix of supervised and unsupervised techniques on 3 datasets: NCT-CRC-HE-100K, Digital Pathology and Artifacts and Animal Faces-HQ.

Files are ipynb. Each file contains a description of its content in the beginiing. In general, you just need to install the libraries imported in the start of the files and just run the code. to train and then test.
